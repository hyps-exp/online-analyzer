1. How to launch.
   1.1 Launch analyzer by using shell script in the sksterm4.
   $ analyzer
     The program is launched with the online mode. It connects to DAQ.
   $ analyzer 08100
     The program is launched with the semi-online mode. The raw data file, which is already stored in HDD, are loaded.
   These shell script files are in sks@sksterm4:~/bin.

   1.2 Launch analyzer manually.
   Go to analyzer directory in the sksterm4.
   $ ./bin/raw_hist_e13 /param/conf/analyzer_20150611 eb0:8901
     The program is launched with the online mode.
   $ ./bin/raw_hist_e13 /param/conf/analyzer_20150611 /***/run08100.dat.gz
     The program is launched with the semi-online mode.

   If you want to launch analyzer in your computer, you should prepare the parameter fils, and connect your computer to the private network in which the DAQ machine exists.

   *** Note ***
   If you give the 4th argument to the scaler_ana like this,
   $ ./bin/scaler_ana /param/conf/analyzer_20150611 eb0:8901 hoge
   the scaler_ana is launched with the spill by spill mode.
